===================

Repository for the course The Data Scientistâ€™s Toolbox

## What do you find in here?

All the material that I have to submit into the COURSERA plattform for the reference course. It is my very first trying and I really hope everything goes easy.

## The table of content

I will try to keep this place up to date and give myself a little of practices with markdown, looking forward to use it at the final project.

- This _README.md_ to be shown as default in my Gith directory 
- The _HelloWorld.Rmd_ file for the first submission of the course, pretty good.
- The _HelloWorld.md_, not really interesting at all
- The _HelloWorld.pdf_, an automatic nice looking output (if you have a LaTeX installation like I do.)
- Another output _HelloWorld.html_ form my RStudio installation
