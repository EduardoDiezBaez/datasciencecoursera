===================

Repository for the course The Data Scientistâ€™s Toolbox

## What do you find in here?

All the material that I have to submit into the COURSERA plattform for the reference course. It is my very first trying and I really hope everything goes easy.

## The table of content

I will try to keep this place up to date and give myself a little of practices with markdown, looking forward to use it at the final project.

- This README.md to to shown as default in my Gith directory 
- HelloWorld.Rmd, pretty good.
- HelloWorld.md, not really interesting at all
- HelloWorld.pdf, an automatic nice looking output (if you have $\LaTeX$)
- HelloWorld.html, another
